# Timestamp Microservice

This Node.js application provides a simple API for converting dates and timestamps.

[Try it here...](https://timestamp.up.railway.app/)

## What it does:

- Converts a valid date string to both Unix timestamp (milliseconds since epoch) and UTC format (e.g., "Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT").
- Handles Unix timestamps directly, returning the equivalent date in both formats.
- Returns the current date and time in both formats if no date is provided.
